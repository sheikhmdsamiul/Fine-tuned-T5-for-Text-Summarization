# Fine-tuned-T5-for-Text-Summarization
This repository contains an IPython Notebook where the T5-small model is fine-tuned for generating summaries of large text contexts. The T5 model (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) is a powerful pre-trained model for various NLP tasks, including summarization. This model is specifically trained on the multi_news dataset to create concise and informative summaries.
